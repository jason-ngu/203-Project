# 203-Project
Long term project using object-oriented concepts to optimize and refactor

This project is a simulation with different sprites including miners,
blobs, and blacksmiths. It utilizes a viewport that acts as the 
camera so the user can change the view. The VirtualWorld handles most 
of the majority of processes in terms of creating entities and parsing
them. Characters spawn after a while and they can move depending on 
certain variables depending on the other characters and obstacles 
around them.The graphics are accessed through the ImageStore and then 
generated in the WorldView and WorldModel. The project is designed
so that the Ores spawn near the Veins and the Miners will move towards
the Ores.
